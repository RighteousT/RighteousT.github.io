            <h2>Quest 1: Loop Through a List of Favorite Foods</h2>
            <p>
                Write a program that stores a list of your top five favorite foods. Then, use a loop to iterate through this list and print each food item along with its rank. For example:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
Favorite Food #1: Pizza
Favorite Food #2: Sushi
Favorite Food #3: Tacos
...</code></pre>
            <p>Tip: Try using a `for` loop and `enumerate()` to display the rank and food item together.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="quest">
            <h2>Quest 2: Counting Even Numbers in a List</h2>
            <p>
                Create a list containing at least ten numbers. Write a program to go through the list and count how many of those numbers are even. Display the total count at the end. For example, if your list is:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code></pre>
            <p>Your output should say something like:</p>
            <pre><code>There are 5 even numbers in the list.</code></pre>
            <p>Tip: Use a loop and the modulus operator (`%`) to check for even numbers.</p>
